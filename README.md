# active_learning

Error log is in err_log.txt

command to run code in terminal:
python ial_driver.py

Code successfully runs up to and including "ob.initialize_ML()"
Code works fine on CPU but error generated from "ob.run_ML()"


I made a separate environment, tf_liver, where I run this code for GPU access. I ran conda list > modules_in_env.txt so you can see what packages and versions I have.
